									<h3 style="color:#f56a6a;">AI for Climate Modeling</h3>
									Numerical weather and climate models simulate the physics governing the Earth system to generate real-time weather forecasts and long-term climate projections. 
									Since the mid-20th century, numerical weather prediction has been the foundation of weather forecasting, providing enormous societal benefits. 
									Climate models have also been instrumental in understanding the impact of anthropogenic emissions on our current and future climate and informed mitigation and adaptation strategies. 
									Although the accuracy of weather and climate models has improved in recent decades, they have become increasingly complex and computationally expensive. 
									Advances in machine learning techniques, the availability of high-performance computing, and the emergence of large high-dimensional meteorological 
									datasets have made deep learning-based weather and climate models increasingly attractive.
									 My research aims to leverage explainable, physics-informed deep learning techniques to improve existing weather and climate models.

									The Arctic and Antarctic are a fundamental part of the climate system, and short-term and long-term changes in their climate can influence 
									Earth's global radiative budget, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, meridional heat transport and extreme weather in the midlatitudes. 
									I am broadly interested in sea ice variability and predictability and better understanding the coupled interactions between sea ice the atmosphere and the ocean.

									<h3 style="color:#f56a6a;">Climate Dynamics and Climate Change </h3>
									Global climate is controlled by complex interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, crysophere, and land. 
									Disentangling the relative contribution of anthropogenic warming and multidecadal internal variability is 
									challenging due to this complex coupling, limited observational data, incorrect climate models. 
									My research aims to better understand the physics controlling recent and projected climate change. 
									My recent work examines the impact of cloud feedbacks on multidecadal internal variability in the tropical Eastern Pacific.

									<h3>Drivers of the Seasonal Delay of Rainfall in the Amazon Rainforest</h3>
									
									<p>The findings of this work were presented at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) August 2021 Intern Symposium </p>
									<p>
										Tropical precipitation has a distinct annual cycle characterized by an amplitude, the range between wet and dry seasons, and phase, their onset timing. Previous studies have reported a seasonal delay in the onset of precipitation in observations over the northern tropical land driven by changes in greenhouse gases (GHG) and anthropogenic aerosols (AER). Though it is well known that the phase of the annual precipitation cycle is projected to be delayed over land under global warming, it is unclear whether changes in GHG and AERs are the dominate external forcings for different regions. Due to its outsized importance in the global Earth system, changes in the precipitation cycle in the Amazon are of particular interest. Here, we use multi-model output of historical and individual forcing simulations to show that the seasonal delay of precipitation in the Amazon rainforest cannot be fully explained by changes in GHG and AER. We examine the impact of land use and land cover change (LULCC; e.g. deforestation) on the seasonal delay of rainfall by examining the historical and future simulations without changes in LULCC, and we perform an atmospheric energy budget analysis for the Amazon Basin.

									<p>NetQuil is an open-source Python framework for quantum networking simulations built on the quantum computing framework pyQuil, by Rigetti Computing. NetQuil is built for testing ideas in quantum network topology and distributed quantum protocol. It allows users to create multi-agent networks, connect parties through classical and quantum channels, and introduce noise. NetQuil also makes running multiple trials for non-deterministic experiments, reviewing traffic in real-time, and synchronizing agents based on local and master clocks simple and easy. We provide an overview of the state of distributed quantum protocol and a basic introduction to netQuil's framework. Finally, we present several demonstrations of canonical quantum information protocols built using netQuil's distributed quantum gates and pyQuil.</p>

									<p>While at the <a href="https://www.henrysfork.org/">Henry's Fork Foundation</a> (HFF), I helped build an automated data-collection network of sensors in the Henry’s Fork Water Shed near Yellowstone National Park. To accompany this data-collection network, I then led an effort to build and published a real-time water quality monitoring website. Since 2018, the website has been frequently used by local scientists to study the health of the Henry's Fork hydrological system and has served as the cornerstone of HFF’s scientific communication mission.</p>

									<!-- <p>
										In recent decades, observed sea surface temperature (SST) trends have cooled in the eastern tropical 
										Pacific and warmed in the western tropical Pacific. Historical simulations using state-of-the-art climate 
										models fail to reproduce this pattern of warming. We find that the feedback between low-lying clouds and 
										SSTs, to first-order, explains model-to-model differences in the magnitude of naturally occurring SST 
										variability in the southeast Pacific. On average, climate models have too weak a cloud-SST feedback, 
										and as a result underpredict the likelihood of multi-decadal cooling in the eastern Pacific in preindustrial
										experiments. Cloud-SST feedback enhances local radiation anomalies and amplifies the wind-evaporation-SST
										feedback.

									<!-- <h3>Interannual Variability of Sea Ice Area</h3>
									<p>
										Sea ice is an important component of the climate system and one that is rapidly changing due to global warming. 
										While it is well known that mean Arctic sea ice area is declining due, less attention has been focused on understanding how the interannual variaiblity of 
										sea ice area is changing in a warming planet. Changes to sea ice area variability have important implications for forecasting, extreme events, and attribution science.  
										Here, we study how interannual varability of sea ice area in the Arctic and Antarctic is changing due to climate change. We explore seasonal, hemispheric, and model differences,
										and compare observations with models.

										Atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) or “buoyancy waves” are generated
										by perturbations in a stably-stratified environment. They mediate momentum transport between the lower
										and middle atmospheres and play a leading-order role in driving middle atmospheric circulation. Due to
										computational constraints, global climate models “parameterize” or estimate the effect of GWs on the largescale flow. Current climate predictions are sensitive to uncertainties in these representations. Here, we examine
										whether machine learning, given limited data, can be used for gravity wave parameterization (GWP) in climate
										prediction. This approach represents an appealing technique to build data-driven GWPs that can reduce existing
										uncertainties by incorporating observations.

										<p>Pressure-time profiles of the zonal mean zonal wind, averaged between 5°S and 5°N and smoothed with a 15-day low pass filter, show the behavior of the
											Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) in integrations of (a) the control version of Model of an Idealized Moist Atmosphere with the AD99 parameterization, (b) the model
											coupled with WaveNet, (c) a 4xCO2 integration with the AD99 parameterization, and (d) a 4xCO2 integration coupled with WaveNet. Vertical dashed lines separate
											5 years segments. The westerly (red) and easterly (blue) bands correspond to winds associated with opposite phases of the QBO. The QBO period and amplitudes are
											calculated using the transition time (TT) method. The dashed-horizontal line in each panel delineates the model level (≈10 hPa) where the TT method is used.</p>
